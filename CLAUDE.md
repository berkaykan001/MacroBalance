# MacroBalance - Macro Calculator Mobile App

## Project Overview

MacroBalance is a React Native mobile application designed to help users calculate the exact portions (in grams) of foods needed to meet specific macro targets for each meal. The app solves the common problem of knowing what macros you need but not knowing how much of each food to eat to achieve those targets.

## Core Problem Statement

Users know:
- Their macro targets for each meal (protein, carbs, fat)
- What foods they want to eat
- The nutritional content of foods

Users need:
- Exact portion sizes (in grams) to meet their macro targets
- Interactive adjustment of portions with automatic recalculation
- Meal-based macro planning with customizable targets

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Development**: Expo Go for testing
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useContext)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Version Control**: Git with frequent commits

## UI/UX Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Modern & Elegant**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth animations
- **Tech-Forward**: Dark theme with accent colors, gradient elements
- **Intuitive**: Clear navigation, logical information hierarchy
- **Responsive**: Optimized for various screen sizes

### Key Screens
1. **Home/Dashboard**: Quick access to recent meals, daily overview
2. **Meal Planning**: Main calculator interface with sliders
3. **Food Search**: Searchable database with filters
4. **Food Management**: Add/edit foods
5. **Meal Configuration**: Customize meal targets
6. **Settings**: App preferences, user profile

### Interaction Patterns
- **Sliders**: Primary interaction for portion adjustment
- **Cards**: Food items, meal summaries
- **Progress Bars**: Macro target achievement
- **Search**: Real-time filtering with suggestions
- **Swipe Gestures**: Quick actions (delete, favorite)

## Algorithm Design

### Macro Calculation Engine
The core challenge is solving a system of equations where:
- Each food contributes macros proportional to its weight
- Total macros must meet targets
- User adjusts one food, others auto-adjust

**Approach**: Proportional redistribution algorithm
1. User adjusts Food A portion
2. Calculate remaining macro needs
3. Redistribute remaining needs among other foods proportionally
4. Apply constraints (minimum portions, food availability)
