KEYBOARD DOUBLE-TAP FIX LOG
===========================
Date: 2025-01-22
Issue: Persistent double-tap keyboard problem across the app

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
- When screen keyboard is open and user presses a button/touchable element
- First tap dismisses keyboard but doesn't trigger the action
- Second tap is required to actually trigger the button action
- User reported this has been an ongoing issue tried to fix twice before

RESEARCH CONDUCTED:
- Used brave-search MCP to research React Native keyboard handling best practices
- Found that TouchableWithoutFeedback can block touch events when dismissing keyboard
- keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" is the recommended solution for ScrollView components

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
1. TouchableWithoutFeedback wrappers were blocking touch propagation
2. Manual Keyboard.dismiss() calls with setTimeout delays were interfering with natural touch handling
3. Missing keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" on some ScrollView components

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
Applied systematic fixes across 4 key files:

1. /src/screens/MealPlanning/MealPlanningScreen.js
   - REMOVED: TouchableWithoutFeedback wrapper around entire content
   - CONFIRMED: keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" on ScrollView (line 178)
   - CLEANED: Imports to remove unused TouchableWithoutFeedback and Keyboard

2. /src/screens/FoodManagement/FoodManagementScreen.js
   - REMOVED: TouchableWithoutFeedback wrapper from header section
   - CONFIRMED: keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" already present on FlatList (line 225)
   - CLEANED: Imports to remove unused TouchableWithoutFeedback and Keyboard

3. /src/components/EditMealModal.js
   - CONFIRMED: keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" already present on ScrollView (line 457)
   - REMOVED: TouchableWithoutFeedback wrapper from selectedFoodsContainer section
   - CLEANED: Imports to remove unused TouchableWithoutFeedback

4. /src/screens/DishCreator/DishCreatorScreen.js
   - REMOVED: Keyboard.dismiss() and setTimeout() calls from button handlers
   - CONFIRMED: keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" already present on ScrollView (line 178)
   - FIXED: Three button handlers that were manually dismissing keyboard:
     * Remove ingredient button (line 104-106 → simplified to direct call)
     * Add ingredient from food list (line 143-145 → simplified to direct call)
     * Add ingredient toggle button (line 198-200 → simplified to direct call)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" allows ScrollView to handle touches properly when keyboard is open
- Removing TouchableWithoutFeedback prevents touch event blocking
- Eliminating manual Keyboard.dismiss() calls lets React Native handle keyboard naturally
- All screens now use consistent keyboard handling approach

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/screens/MealPlanning/MealPlanningScreen.js
2. src/screens/FoodManagement/FoodManagementScreen.js  
3. src/components/EditMealModal.js
4. src/screens/DishCreator/DishCreatorScreen.js

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Test button interactions while TextInput keyboard is open
- Verify single-tap behavior works across all 4 modified screens
- Check that keyboard still dismisses properly when tapping outside input fields
- Confirm no regressions in existing functionality

FALLBACK STRATEGIES IF ISSUE PERSISTS:
1. Check if any other screens have similar TouchableWithoutFeedback patterns
2. Verify all TextInput components have proper keyboard handling
3. Consider adding keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled" to any missed FlatList/ScrollView components
4. Investigate if specific device/OS versions need different keyboard handling approaches
5. Look into using KeyboardAvoidingView if vertical space issues arise

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS MENTIONED:
- User mentioned this issue was "tried to fix it twice before but nothing worked"
- This systematic approach addresses the root cause rather than symptom fixes
- Focuses on React Native's built-in keyboard handling rather than manual intervention
