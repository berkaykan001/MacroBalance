## Emergency Bypass

If tests are failing due to external dependencies or environment issues:
1. Document the issue in commit message
2. Create separate issue to track test fix
3. Only bypass for critical fixes or infrastructure issues

## Post-Commit Actions

After successful commit:
- [ ] Verify commit appears in git log
- [ ] Test app still works after commit
- [ ] Update project status if major milestone reached
